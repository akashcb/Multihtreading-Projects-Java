Several projects like CoffeeShopSimulation provides simulation of multithreading used in java to act as seperate entities in a coffee shop.
Also other projects like AuctionServer - typical seller bidder scenario. Sellers can sell items by posting them in parallel and bidders can bid on the items in parallel.
The bidder with highest bid will get the product provided bidder has the necessary cash in his or her account maintained in the system.
